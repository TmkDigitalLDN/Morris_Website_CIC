                We are raising funds to provide youth with the life skills
                (Like taxes, cooking, accounting, survival, emotional
                intelligence) that mainstream schooling does not provide.
                Our target is Â£10,000.

              <p className="paragraph-lg c-grey">
                In light of the rising incidents of knife and gun crime
                among today's youths, I have decided to use my knowledge and
                wisdom to establish the charity
                Morristheconnectorcic.org.uk. My goal is to provide an
                alternative form of education that teaches life skills and
                empowerment to youths in England, with plans to eventually
                expand to Africa. I am now invited to schools to share my
                experience and wisdom with the next generation.
              </p>

                I am also committed to raising funds for my charity by
                participating in a boxing event. The charity is called the
                Fixed Mindset and Growth Mindset Program, aimed at providing
                a better reality for disadvantaged youths to live in society
                and promote morality.
